## Title of the Project
FORECASTING GOLD PRICE ON AN ECONOMIC DRIVEN MARKET

## About

The Gold Price Prediction App addresses the challenge of forecasting future gold prices by analyzing          various economic indicators, such as inflation rates, unemployment rates, and GDP. Gold prices are influenced by numerous complex factors, making accurate predictions difficult. This project aims to provide users with a machine learning-based solution that simplifies the process of predicting gold prices using historical data and economic trends. By offering a comparison of multiple models and allowing users to input future economic conditions, the app empowers users to make data-driven decisions about gold price movements.

## Features

- Integration of multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree) for gold price prediction.
- Use of economic indicators such as inflation rate, unemployment rate, GDP, and applied interest rates as input features.
- Real-time prediction capability by allowing users to input future economic data for forecasting.
- Data preprocessing steps including feature scaling, label encoding, and handling missing values to improve model accuracy.
